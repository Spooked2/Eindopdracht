        <h1>The spectacular Spider-Man's site</h1>

        <p>
            Welcome to the site of New-York's one and only Spider-Man! If you wanted to know all about the crooks and
            goons trying their best to destroy New-York whom Spirder-Man is working tirelessly to stop, or if you wanted
            to know more about me, then you're in
            the right place. All pictures here are courtesy of Peter Parker, and I don't know how he does it but he
            always manages to catch my good side! If you've seen any of these villains around town lately, please do
            send in your sighting at the bottom of this page so I can tell them to buzz off in person.

                            The Shocker, also known as Montana, is one of the lower ranking goons. He relies on some
                            sort of
                            shocking glove thingy, a pretty fancy piece of tech, hence his name. While he's still quite
                            a
                            threat, I've gotten his moves down enough to where I can reliably take him down when he's
                            alone.
                            It's a different story when he's working with some other goons however.

                            Sandman is one of the first guys I ever took down as Spider-Man, though he was still an
                            average
                            crook at the time. Now he's somehow gotten sand powers! Thankfully it looks like 'ol Flint
                            here
                            has decided to turn a new leaf.

                            This guy Quentin is a real handful, and also totally lame. He just gave up when I caught him
                            without his machines! I'm not complaining about having it easy for once, but this tanks his
                            bad
                            guy score. Awful motivation too, guy could get a nice job as an engineer but he chooses to
                            do
                            this instead!
